    "text": "The State of Madhya Pradesh is bestowed with 3,08,245 square kilometer of area with major river the Narmada and the Tapti flowing through it. It has 258 Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs) which oversee the working of agricultural produce across eight division of the state. Out of these 258 APMCs 39, 41, 57 and 121 are respectively number of ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’ grade APMCs during 2019. The wide variation in number of notified commodities bought and sold in various yards across the states makes spatial distribution mapping a necessity. An atlas can provide valuable spatio-temporal understanding by way of graphical representation. The macro picture can reveal several patterns that are hard to visualize from large chunk of data. A series of map on same aspect over the years also facilitate comparison over a period of time. All this can greatly enhance the understanding of market and facilitate planning and policy making. Previously attempts were made at the national level to bring out Agriculture Market Atlas of India and various agricultural and horticultural atlas to depict spatial diversity across the state and India. However, there is no attempt at the state level to prepare Agriculture Market Atlas for the state of Madhya Pradesh. This first attempt in the State of Madhya Pradesh would greatly enhance the quality of policy making vis-a-vis help economist increase curiosity in agricultural economy of the Madhya Pradesh."

The R software for Statistical Computing (2022) was utilized along with sp (Pebesma and Bivand 2005) , rgdal (Bivand, Keitt, and Rowlingson 2022) and tmap (Tennekes 2018) packages. The book was prepared and compiled with the help of Quarto Markdown Publishing System(Allaire 2022). The shape file of Madhya Pradesh with district boundaries was obtained from NAHEP CAAST on “Skill Development to Use of Spatial Data for Natural Resources Management in Agriculture” located at College of Agriculture Engineering, JNKVV, Jabapur. For calculating the average price prevailing in the district and state, weights were assigned using arrivals. For categorization of markets, average values of price and arrivals for the state of Madhya Pradesh was considered. A district categorized as district with “High Price” if its annual average price was greater than the state average price for the given commodity else categorized as district with “Low Price”. Similarly, district having average arrivals above state average arrivals were categorized as districts with “High Arrivals” else categorized as district with “Low Arrivals”. For calculating during and before COVID price and arrivals, year 2020 and 2021 were considered as during COVID years.\n\n\n\n\nAllaire, JJ. 2022. “Quarto: R Interface to ’Quarto’ Markdown Publishing System.” https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=quarto.\n\n\nBivand, Roger, Tim Keitt, and Barry Rowlingson. 2022. “Rgdal: Bindings for the ’Geospatial’ Data Abstraction Library.” https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgdal.\n\n\nPebesma, Edzer J., and Roger S.
